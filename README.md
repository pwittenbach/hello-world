# hello-world

Hi Earthlings!

Patrick here! I'm a Chemical Engineer/Petroleum Engineer by schooling and have worked in the oil and gas space for the last five years. Now I'm looking to make the jump into data science! The power of machine learning and artificial intelligence is mind blowing, and I couldn't be more excited for this journey.

I love my wife, my dog, and ZA!
